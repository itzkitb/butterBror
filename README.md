- The bot is not responding to my commands
> 1. Check that the bot is in the chat/group<br>
> 2. Make sure that the bot is currently available. You can check this by opening his Twitch chat. There he sends telemetry every 10 minutes<br>
> 3. Make sure that you are not banned or ignored<br>
> 3.1 At the moment, the ignore team is being developed, if you want the bot not to respond to your bot's messages, then write about it [to me](mailto:itzkitb@gmail.com)<br>
> 3.2 If the bot is responding to messages from other users, then you are probably banned. Make sure that you have not violated the rules of use and privacy policy of the bot. If the lock happened by accident or you want to write a request for unblocking, then write [here](mailto:itzkitb@gmail.com)
